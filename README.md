# Cplusplus-Program

This project was an investment calculator. The user could submit an initial deposit, interest rate, number of years, and a monthly deposit. The program would then output two charts, one with the amount of interest earned and total money with monthly deposits, and one without. The program worked well, with everything being neatly formatted, all calculations being performed correctly, and the user interface working as expected. If I were to improve it, I would like to improve the interface so that the user did not have to go back to the main screen and enter all new information to see an updated chart. For example, they could maybe just adjust one parameter and update the chart, or use something like a sliding scale.

The most challenging part for me was deciding exactly how to split up the code between the Savings and main files, because this was the first program I had created with multiple files. Because using multiple files and object oriented programming are essential skills in the programming business, these are good skills to learn and transfer to other projects. In addition, by using classes, consistent naming practices, and plenty of comments, I was able to make a maintainable and readable program.
